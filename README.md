## Project
This is a basic tic-tac-toe with 4 components, namely Square.js, Board.js and Game.js and App component. App component renders the Game component.
 
Board component renders the basic template for tic-tac-toe game and also renders Square as its child component. Each Square component has Button inside which display either 'X' or 'O' based on the player.

The Game component has all the logic, it renders the Board component, shows Game status, New Game Button, Number of Moves. It passes down props to the Board component, Board component passes the props down to the Square Component.

Game Status - Displays which player should go next. Eg: Player: X or Player: O . It also displays if there is a winner or if the game is draw.

## Testing using Jest and Enzyme

I have used Test Driven approach using Jest and Enzyme to test if each component renders correctly and also the button functionality. Each commit is done when the test case failed to render components correctly, after passing the test and after refractoring the test, component based on the application logic.

NOTE: There is a setUpTests.js under src folder which is necessary for the react version 16 for enzyme to function correctly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
